Add a link in the WordPress dashboard to access the customizer. A space to configure the site identity (Site title, Tagline, Site icon), The menus (Add new, Menus locations, Menus Options), the Homepage Settings (display latest posts or static page) and add additional CSS. **This is very useful if your block-based theme does not display the tab that allows you to add your CSS styles**

= Disable files editor for plugins and themes =
**Improve security and reduce the risk of potential vulnerabilities**. By disabling the file editor, WordPress administrators are forced to make changes to the code using a more secure method, such as editing the files locally and then uploading them to the server via FTP, or using a plugin to manage code changes.
